* Usage
The following command will compile example.bas to UVM assembly.
#+begin_src bash
clj -M basic.clj example.bas
#+end_src

* Example
look at example.bas for an example. It will produce the following image

#+begin_src basic
0 FOR c 0 TO 74
10 IF 38 > c THEN LET color 16711680 ELSE LET color 255
20 PLOT (75-c) (75-c) color
30 PLOT c (75-c) color
40 PLOT 37 c color
50 PLOT 38 c color
60 PLOT c 37 color
